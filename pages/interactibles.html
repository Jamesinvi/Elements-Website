                        Hello again! This week we'll be looking at Platforms and Interactibles. To be honest moving
                        platforms took me a ridiculous amount
                        of time given how simple of a task it is going through various iterations before settling the
                        current solution.
                        Nevertheless, lets start with Interactibles. My code is setup using mostly Inheritance
                        with some abstract classes that define generic fields and methods for any given type of object.
                        I am aware that some
                        (if not most) games use Interfaces way more but I ultimately decided to use inheritance because
                        I was more used to that
                        style. So for interactible objects, I created an abstract class from which every object would
                        derive from.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First off let's define what every interactible object does:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Displays Interact GUI when the player is close.</li>
                            <li>Does "Something" when interacted with</li>
                            <li>If it cannot be interacted with, do something else (eg. show an error string)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One way to know if the player is close is to subtract the position of the object to position of
                        the player, but that
                        would mean that <strong>every</strong> interactible object would have to keep track of the
                        player individually and doing
                        that calculation every update. Instead, I used a trigger collider and every time something
                        tagged as "Player" entered the trigger,
                        it would show a simple GUI element to the player.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now it needs to do something when interacted with, and there are a couple of ways to do this.
                        The choice is between a C# event (my first approach)
                        or a UnityEvent (what I decided to use). Unity events are basically a wrapper for native C#
                        events and they are slower (a lot slower) but are perfectly integrated
                        in the Unity editor so they give a very helpful UI where you can drag GameObjects and select
                        which method to call when the event is triggered.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So this is what the interactible class looks like:

                    </p>

                    <img src="../media/interactible_1.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">

                    <p>
                        Now we need a class that extends the Interactible class. The first that came to mind and that I
                        used extensively in my levels is a
                        InteractionSender. This class is an almost direct implementation with an some extra features
                        tied in like an animator and the ability
                        to activate or disable the emission of the material it's on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also implemented an Interaction Reciever class, I know it's slightly redundant but it helps
                        tie events easily in the inspector and also
                        means that the recieving object isn't tied to the sender to recieve commands.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Moving Platforms
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        When I first started implementing platforms, I thought they were easy but I soon realised that
                        to get a decent looking moving platform,
                        it would require a little more than antipated. First off, the desired behaviour is that the
                        player moves with the platform, but as illustrated
                        in my beautiful artistic rendition, that's not what happens normally.
                    </p>

                    <img src="../media/moving_platform_1.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">

                    <p>
                        So basically we'll need another trigger collider to make the player a child of the moving
                        platform so that the player won't fall off.
                        Now onto the bigger problem: the movement itself.
                        Here are the methods I tried to implement:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Linearly interpolating between two positions.</li>
                            <li>Linearly interpolating between two Transforms </li>
                            <li>Using fancy math to generate runtime curves to drive the platform </li>
                            <li>Using a Coroutine to start the platform moving in one direction for a fixed amount of
                                time and then firing a second one to reverse it</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first three methods have a big problem: versatility. For any given platform there is no way
                        for it to go around in a circle, or move in
                        any other pattern without having a long list of objects to interpolate between. The coroutine is
                        a little better because the only thing that
                        that drives the movement is time. This approach however, is very CPU intensive because it would
                        be firing multiple coroutines (<strong>per platform</strong>).

                        The best way to tackle this in my opinion is with animation, more specifically animation curves.
                        AnimationCurve is a type of variable you can use in Unity that lets
                        you specify any curve you want and then sample or modify it in the script. Here's the Moving
                        platform class and the inspector view:
                    </p>

                    <img src="../media/moving_platform_3.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">
                    <img src="../media/moving_platform_2.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">

                    <p>
                        Note that this class inherits from InteractionReciever so we can use the OnActivate event it
                        inherits to tell the platform to move.
                        It will then sample the AnimationCurve every frame to know where it's next position will be.
                        After that it will interpolate between the
                        initial position and the target position. Every AnimationCurve can be set to
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clamp: After the curve finishes, it will stay at that position forever</li>
                            <li>Loop: After the curve finishes, will start again from the first value, looping forever.
                            </li>
                            <li>PingPong: After the curve finishes, it will play the animation backwards, looping
                                forever </li>
                        </ol>
                        Most Platforms will be PingPong, but then I realised I could use the Clamped curve to make the
                        doors open hiding the door under the terrain
                        after the animation finishes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also implemented a enum containing all the different types of a platform: Standard, Stepper,
                        and Falling (more will be probabily added).
                        Stepper is a platform that only move a fixed amount (or step) <strong>per activation</strong>,
                        for example the player may have to orient
                        some mirrors in the correct way to complete the level (more info coming in the future). Falling
                        is pretty self-explanatory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That pretty much covers it! Thank you for reading and I'll finish this post with some examples
                        of how these platforms look in-game (note that
                        any stuttering is only because these are gifs):
