                    The Idea
                </h3>
                <p class="center">
                    Elements is a 3D adventure-platformer focused on a large scale world and fully fleshed out universe. There will
                    be four main areas (based on the Elements) with a number of level/zones to complete and explore. All of the
                    creatures and zones in this world are a rapresentation or combination of the four Elements: Fire, Water, Air and
                    Earth. The zones will test the ability of the player to traverse the zone, solve puzzles, and make his way
                    through ancient enemies and dangers. The obstacles the player faces will vary from moving platforms and
                    dangerous lasers to flying beams and more. Another important aspect of the game is exploration and collectibles,
                    the player will collect various currencies that he will use to clear the way of locked portals and will be
                    rewarded for exploration by the ability to disable certain obstacles based on the currency he has obtained on
                    the way. The player will start in the Earth zone and as the story progresses he will face the Fire, Air and
                    Water zones.

                    State of the Project
                </h3>
                <p class="center">
                    The project is in full development and a Demo level has been constructed to illustrate what the gameplay may
                    feel like. The demo takes place in the Earth zone and is one of the first the player will face. As of writing
                    this, the world terrain map is done and textured, the most important game systems such as player movement,
                    combat stats, buffs, (prototype) UI, camera movement, items, respawns, and combat are mostly complete together
                    with the systems required for a level (such as platforms, gates, portals, collectibles, beams and puzzle solving
                    elements). All of the assets and models are custom made and the goal is too make all the assets ourselves
                    whenever possible. If you are interested in seeing the world and some of the assets in game check out this demo:

                    The Team
                </h3>
                <p class="center">
                    I am a Informatics Engineering student in Rome and I am doing all of the work in the engine and in the modeling
                    software (Blender). Also on the team are two friend and they're responsible for some of the art. If you are
                    willing to join the team we will consider everybody but right now the most critical thing we're looking for is
                    character design, modeling and animation. If you interested in the project don't hesitate contacting me via
                    e-mail (see the bottom of the page).
