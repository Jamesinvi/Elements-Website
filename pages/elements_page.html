                        Elements is a 3D adventure-platformer focused on a large scale world and fully fleshed out
                        universe. There will
                        be four main areas (based on the Elements) with a number of level/zones to complete and explore.
                        All of the
                        creatures and zones in this world are a representation or combination of the four Elements:
                        Fire, Water, Air and
                        Earth. The zones will test the ability of the player to traverse the zone, solve puzzles, and
                        make his way
                        through ancient enemies and dangers. The obstacles the player faces will vary from moving
                        platforms and
                        dangerous lasers to flying beams and more. Another important aspect of the game is exploration
                        and collectibles,
                        the player will collect various currencies that he will use to clear the way of locked portals
                        and will be
                        rewarded for exploration by the ability to disable certain obstacles based on the currency he
                        has obtained on
                        the way. The player will start in the Earth zone and as the story progresses he will face the
                        Fire, Air and
                        Water zones. The main character will learn to master and harness the power of the Elements by 
                        completing challenges and exploring the world.

                        The project is in development and a Demo level will be available as soon as possible! If
                        you're curious as to how things are being developed check out the monthly posts we will upload to learn
                        more. If you have any further questions or you wish to contact me for any reason, feel free to do so
                        by email or on any social media. The project will soon begin a Kickstarter campaign so be sure to check it out

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a Informatics Engineering student in Rome and I am doing all of the work in the engine and
                        in the modeling
                        software (Blender). Also on the team are two friend and they're responsible for some of the art.
                        Our approach at creating a cohesive world is procedural generation starting from a hand-crafted sketch
                        and then manually tweaking the result and adding finishing touches. If you wish to join our team on the project
                        we're happy to look at your work/portfolio just email me and I'll reply right away.
