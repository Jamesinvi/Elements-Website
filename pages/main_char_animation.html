                    <h3>The original Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Creating a character for Elements was by far the hardest challenge so far and while the character model isn't completely 
                        finished, it's enough to rig and animate, as you'll see. We went through several iterations before finally settling on 
                        version 7, I'll show here some of the previous attempts (most of them are not complete because we abandoned them before finishing them).

                    </p>
                    <div class="gallery">
                        <img src="../media/19.JPG" alt="" />
                        <img src="../media/20.JPG" alt="" />
                        <img src="../media/21.JPG" alt="" />
                        <img src="../media/23.JPG" alt="" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As shown in the images, the design had a major overhaul after the second image. This change was due to a concept art my friend did and we both liked.
                        This is the concept art together with the (almost finished) model: 
                    </p>

                        <img src="../media/24.jpg" alt="" />
                        <img src="../media/22.JPG" alt="" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In case you're wondering "what about the face?", we're still trying different ways of making it work, although early efforts seem to suggest that
                        even no face could be a good option if the rest of the character is animated to account for it. The goal is to avoid having to hand animate face bones,
                        mainly because we don't have a full time animator on the team.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rigging</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rigging is an ardous process, albeit an important one. We tried different ways to rig the character ranging from a manual approach, Rigify for blender and others.
                        The best so far seemed to be to hand build a good Rig. However, correctly exporting animations from Blender to Unity isn't so easy if you want Unity to use IK (Inverse
                        Kinematics), so we found this paid add-on on the blender market: <a href="https://blendermarket.com/products/auto-rig-pro":>Auto-Rig Pro</a>. This add-on is 
                        <b>amazing</b>, it offers a good quick way to create a perfect rig for your needs, and most importantly it has a dedicated exporter for Unity and Unreal Engine.
                        The rig we generated with Auto-Rig Pro has these features:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forward Kinematics for every limb</li>
                        <li>Inverse Kinematics for every limb</li>
                        <li>Fist bones (scale a single bone to close hands into fists)</li>
                        <li>Additional tweak bones to fix any imperfections during animations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Animations</h3>
                    <p>
                        As stated before, we don't have an animator on the team, and this was a big problem and it seems there's no real solution here other than using stock animations (like Mixamo).
                        So I started to learn some of the basics of animation and to be honest, early attempts we're pretty demoralizing. After a couple months of trying (and failing),
                        I managed to create a walk cycle I was mostly satisfied with. After that, Idle, Running and Jumping animations were very similar.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Into Unity</h3>
                    <p>
                        After exporting with the dedicated FBX exporter, Unity should import the model with the correct bone structure for IK and all the clips included.
                        The next step is to create the Animator state machine that drives the animations and all the transitions between animations. To get this to work
                        correctly, we did some research, but good information on this topic is scarce at best, we did however find this very useful Unite (2016) talk from the
                        Firewatch developers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VgQ5PpTqjc">Mecanim Bonsai: Lessons from Firewatch and ReCore</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first step is to create a blend tree that blends between the 3 base animations (Idle, Walk and Run) using movement speed as a variable because using the
                        movement speed instead of player input prevents the character from mindlessly running into walls. Note that we put this blend tree into a sub-state machine called 
                        locomotion, this makes it easier to keep everything clean.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../media/25.JPG" alt="not found" class="image fit">
                    <br>
                    <h4>Jumping</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the jump animation, it's not so straightforward. We created the animation as shown before, but the problem of having a single static animation
                        is that it won't adapt to all (if any) circumstances. To fix this, we tried breaking up the jump animation in two parts: the "going up", and the "falling down" but
                        unfortunately it still wasn't good enough. Looking for inspiration, we downloaded the 3D DevKit from Unity to see what their implementation was like and we found that
                        their jump animation was actually split into 6 air animations plus distinct landing animations for every direction. To make things slightly easier, we split the jump animation into 5 clips, respectively:

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start of the jump (basically only plays when the player presses jump</li>
                        <li>Rising animation (animation for going up)</li>
                        <li>Idle animation (looping animation for when the character is at the jump apex)</li>
                        <li>Fall animation (looping animation for when the character is falling towards the ground)</li>
                        <li>Landing animation (animation for when the character touches the ground)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The next step is to put the first four animations in a blend tree using the vertical speed as the parameter and the fifth as a transitional state before returning to the Locomotion state machine.
                        Note that we created a separate sub-state machine called Airborne that contains all the animations and blendtrees for when the character is in the air. Handling the jump in a blend tree means it can dynamically adapt to the player falling or simply being moved upwards
                        from external sources and not by just the player pressing the jump button. We then added a ledgegrab animation and put it in the Airborne sub-state machine transition from (and to) the jump blendtree.

                    <h3>Other animations</h3>
                    <p>
                        As you can tell from the previous video, there are some other animations in the animator such as "Punch" and "Spin",
                        those are relatively simple and they transition using a trigger (you could also use a boolean).
                        Bear in mind, we plan to have different combos when triggering a move from a different state (e.g. Jump-punch or
                        Jump-spin combo).
                        Here are the punch and spin
                        animations in action (they still need tweaking).

                    <h3>Inverse Kinematics</h3>
                    <p>
                        We originally planned to make use of squash and stretch in our animations, but it turns out that even though Auto-Rig Pro can properly export those kinds of animation,
                        Unity really doesn't play nice and prevents you from using their humanoid skeleton for any kind of IK so we ditched the squashy animations entirely. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make use of IK we turned on "IK pass" in the animator layer, we placed scripts that would control specific parts of the character: FeetIK, HeadIK and HandsIK but they all work in exactly the same way. Let's take
                        a look at FeetIK
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>

public class FeetIK : MonoBehaviour {
    public LayerMask detectionMask;
    public float raycastLength;
    public bool active;
    private Animator anim;

    // Called before first Update
    void Start() {
        anim = GetComponent<Animator>();
    }

    // Called by the Animator Component immediately before it updates its internal IK system
    private void OnAnimatorIK() {
        if (anim && active) {

            //Set the weights the value defined by animation curves of the animation
            anim.SetIKPositionWeight(AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot, anim.GetFloat("LeftFootIKWeight"));
            anim.SetIKRotationWeight(AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot, anim.GetFloat("LeftFootIKWeight"));

            anim.SetIKPositionWeight(AvatarIKGoal.RightFoot, anim.GetFloat("RightFootIKWeight"));
            anim.SetIKRotationWeight(AvatarIKGoal.RightFoot, anim.GetFloat("RightFootIKWeight"));


            Vector3 upEpsilon = Vector3.up * 0.1f;

            //Left foot
            Ray ray = new Ray(anim.GetIKPosition(AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot) + Vector3.up, Vector3.down);
            RaycastHit hitInfo;
            if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hitInfo, raycastLength, detectionMask)) {
                anim.SetIKPosition(AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot, hitInfo.point + upEpsilon);
                anim.SetIKRotation(AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot, Quaternion.LookRotation(transform.forward, hitInfo.normal));
            }

            //Right foot (reuse the same ray for efficiency)
            ray = new Ray(anim.GetIKPosition(AvatarIKGoal.RightFoot) + Vector3.up, Vector3.down);
            if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hitInfo, raycastLength, detectionMask)) {
                anim.SetIKPosition(AvatarIKGoal.RightFoot, hitInfo.point + upEpsilon);
                anim.SetIKRotation(AvatarIKGoal.RightFoot, Quaternion.LookRotation(transform.forward, hitInfo.normal));
            }
        }
    }
}

                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Basically, the animator can give us the position of the limbs at any given moment, so we just cast a ray from every foot downwards, looking for 
                        any solid ground. If the ray finds something, we then snap the position of the feet to the ground. Before we do that, however, we must set the weights
                        for the IK system (0 meaning the animation just plays normally, 1 meaning the IK is in full effect). We could set that weight to 1 all the time, but that would
                        lead to the feet snapping to the ground in the middle of a walking or running animation. To fix this, we have to create an animation curve setting these weights for 
                        the right and the left foot separately as shown here (Note that the animator parameters and the animation curve MUST have the same name). Ideally the weight will only
                        be 1 when the foot is supposed to be on the ground.

                    <p>
                        This is the a close up of the idle animation before and after applying IK:

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        After this we tried doing the hands and we decided that ledgegrabbing would be a good way to test this basic IK system and even though it's not perfect we're happy with the results:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And that's it! We're pretty happy with the results as they provide a good solid foundation to build upon later on in development. There are still some tweaks to be done to some of the 
                        transitions and some animations but we'll be doing that as a final polishing pass. If you have any questions please email me and I'll reply as soon as I can. See ya!
