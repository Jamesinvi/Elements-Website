                            So, we're making a open world game here, so let's begin with getting a world toghether that
                            fits our
                            needs. Based on the idea of the
                            four elements, we knew we had to have 4 zones the player would progress through, and after
                            we charted a
                            small universe bacgkround story
                            we created a layout of the map. The software we used to generate the map from our layout is
                            World Machine.
                            There are
                            newer and shinier tools but
                            this one fit quite well.
                            World Machine can export files as raw(16bit) wich we then can use in Unity as the Terrain
                            heightmap. This is the result after importing into Unity:

                        <p> For Elements, we're aiming for a low-poly flatshaded style and to
                            achieve this we needed to convert the terrain to a mesh and although this could be achieved
                            by a custom script,
                            i bought
                            a really handy tool
                            from the Unity asset store. After importing and playing around with the parameters, this is
                            what we
                            have:
                        </p>

                        <img src="../media/elements_terrain_unity_close.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">

                        <p>
                            The tool converts the terrain to a mesh dividing it into chunks and automatically creates
                            lower detail meshes
                            to display when the camera is far away (LODs).

                        <h3>
                            Terrain Shader
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            We explored various possibilites to texture the terrain, but we needed a solution that would
                            easily port from
                            heightmap based terrain to a mesh. This meant that splatmap texturing and tri-planar
                            splatmaps were probably gonna be a nightmare
                            so for a while we would just bake a texture from World Machine and apply it to the whole
                            terrain.
                            <br>
                            This worked fairly well
                            but every time there were significant changes to the terrain, we would have to rebake the
                            texture and re-import it.
                            After looking for a solution, we ultimately decided to write our own terrain shader that
                            would dynamically account for slope and altitude.
                            <br>
                            As an added bonus, writing our own shader also means we can add support for vertex coloring
                            with Polybrush to add little details as needed.
                            The only minor drawback is that World Machine is also generating an erosion flowmap and
                            since there's no way to generate one with the final result,
                            we just used the one World Machine gives us (it still gives really good results).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, for this shader we made use of Unity's surface shaders. It's basically the same as
                            writing any vertex-fragment shader but taking away all of the lighting
                            calculations away from you by only defining a "surface function". It's possible to specify
                            all kinds of stuff (like a specific lighing model) including a custom vertex function.
                            I'm going to explain how to achieve a similar effect but i'll leave out most of the code
                            because is not relevant to understanding how the shader works (it's mostly boiler plate
                            code).
                            <br>
                            In the surface function, we begin by getting some information, first we need to know the
                            slope and we understand that from the y value in the world normal :
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                                <code>
float3 slope = saturate(1- saturate((IN.worldNormal.y))*_SlopeMultiplier);

                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        After that, we need the world height:
                        <pre>
                                <code>
float height = ((IN.worldPos.y)/_HeightMultiplier);
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        <p>
                            As you can see, everything until now was tied to a parameter from the inspector
                            (_SlopeMultiplier and _HeightMultiplier), doing so
                            helps you achieve any specific effect without having to edit the shader in the future. To
                            make the
                            height percent share the same property,
                            we need to use some math to get a custom range so we create a function to help us to that:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                                <code>
float3 inverseLerp(float pos, float lowThreshold, float highThreshold) {
    return (saturate((pos - lowThreshold) / (highThreshold - lowThreshold)));
}

...
float heightPercent = inverseLerp(IN.worldPos.y,0.1, _HeightMultiplier);
...
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        <p>
                            In this step we're creating a smooth gradient going from complete darkness at y=0 to pure
                            white at y=_HeightMultiplier.
                            Now we need to sample our texture from World Machine (in the code it's called _DepositTex).
                            In reality, the texture is an RGBA texture
                            with all the colors for the terrain texture, so we only need the alpha channel (where the
                            flowmap is stored).
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                                <code>
float deposit = tex2D(_DepositTex, IN.uv_DepositTex).a;
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        <p>
                            So now that we have all the information, but we now need to transform it in a color to
                            display on the screen. So for our example there are 3
                            height based "biomes": Snowy, Grassy and Sandy. We create two range values in the inspector
                            for a start and end of every biome and create a function
                            to use those parameters. What we want is basically a white strip between the biome start and
                            the biome
                            end while everything else is black, and we do so for every biome. After that is simply a
                            matter of multiplying everything together.
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                                <code>
float2 colorInRange(float start, float end, float heightPercent) {
    float2 interpolated= float2(0,0);
    interpolated.x = smoothstep(start, end, heightPercent);
    interpolated.y = smoothstep(end, start, heightPercent);
    return interpolated;
}
...
float2 snowRange = colorInRange(_SnowStart, _SnowEnd, heightPercent);
float2 grassRange = colorInRange(_GrassStart, _GrassEnd, heightPercent);
float2 sandRange = colorInRange(_SandStart, _SandEnd, heightPercent);
c *= saturate((grassRange.y * grassRange.x * _GrassColor)
+ (sandRange.y * sandRange.x * _SandColor) 
+ (snowRange.y * snowRange.x * _SnowColor) 
+ (slope * _RockColor)) 
+ (deposit * _DepositColor);
c *=(IN.vertexColor); //Add support for vertex colors
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        <p>
                            This is one of the strip we created when using the colorInRange function:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And we're done! This shader is actually also very useful to make rocks blend with the
                            terrain because
                            we're using the same material. Here's how it looks:

                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Terrain Vegetation & Rocks
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            We've looked for an easy solution for placing trees an rocks on a <b>mesh</b> and
                            the
                            only viable
                            solution we came up with was using the Polybrush tool for Unity. This approach had two
                            downsides:
                        </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Quite slow: requires to paint different trees and rocks all over the large terrain.
                                </li>
                                <li>The result can be good, but it heavily depends on your enviromental artist skills.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>
                            So we needed a way to place a large number of trees without having all of them
                            needed to be placed by hand so we decided to go with a custom script that
                            places objects randomly
                            based on slope and height at that particular point. These are the parameters:
                        </p>

                        <img src="../media/unity_placeObjects_script.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">

                        <p>
                            We use a curve to describe how likely it is for an object to spawn at increasing altitudes.
                            The slope parameter on
                            the other hand is the maximum slope at which the object can spawn.

                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Fine tuning the rock placement
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The algorithm works fine for trees but it's not as good for rocks, so we made some changes. The first change we made 
                            to the rock placement algorithm was using a Gaussian distribution for
                            the size
                            instead of a random number in the specified range. While working correctly, we decided to change things a little.
                            The old version would scale the rock based on the altitude: the higher
                            up it was, the
                            smaller it would be. This approach however had a problem:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../media/rock_diagram.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">
                        <p>
                            The algorihm would make Rock 2 bigger because it's much closer to sea level. That might seem
                            like a good thing but
                            in reality, Rock 1 shouldn't be much smaller than Rock 2 because locally, it's on a pretty high
                            and steep cliff.
                            The modified algorithm will check the sorroundings of every rock to find a local minimum (or low
                            point) and scale the rock
                            appropriately. It's pretty difficult to get a screenshot of the full range of sizes but here's
                            what it looks like:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our rock and tree placement script has a way to delete all objects and trees but no way of
                            deciding which to keep so we needed
                            to find a way to make the rocks and trees we liked to stick around. We decided to make all of these
                            objects a child of the "level" object.
                            This worked but we soon realised that generating trees or rocks again for another
                            section of the map would clutter all the other
                            areas with new ones. To fix this, we decided to write a script that would destroy any tree or
                            rock it would collide with assuming it wasn't
                            part of the level itself:

                            I guess it's now time to put it all toghether. We added proper rim lighting, some fog, and
                            some post processing (was alrady there actually)
                            and we get the final result for the Elements terrain and enviroment. Note that when 3D
                            models will be added the terrain could be adjusted and
                            the tree (and rock) placement algorithm could be re-run to get the updated version. Here's
                            some screenshot of the final result:
