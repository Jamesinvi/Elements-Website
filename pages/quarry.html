                        We've been working on the layout of the entire earth zone and all of the specific "levels"
                        contained in it.
                        In this post, we'll be focusing on the Quarry Level. The earth zone is basically a small town
                        sorrounded by ancient
                        ruins and structures, including the Quarry, these will be the "levels". It is important to us to
                        give a different palette and art style to
                        these ancient buildings, we want the player to feel safe in the town and to not feel safe in the
                        ruins. Swapping
                        the palette and style helps achieve this and also makes sense lore-wise. Here's the layout of
                        the Quarry:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reshaping the terrain for the Quarry</h3>
                    <p>
                        As stated in the previous post, if we need to change the terrain, we're gonna have to change the
                        unity version
                        of the standard terrain and then use a script to re-generate the faceted chunks. After doing
                        this, this is what we get:
                    </p>
                    <img src="../media/quarry_1.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">
                    <p>
                        Since this is a pretty drastic change to a part of the terrain, we need to regenerate the
                        texture so that it fits
                        better with the new cliffs and slopes. To do this we export the raw terrain file into World
                        Machine and re-generate
                        the bitmap. We then go back into unity, generate the faceted chunks and apply the texture:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Back to the Quarry</h3>
                    <p>
                        The next thing missing is lava, it's not so simple to pull off so what we did
                        was to go to substance designer and generate a texture for it. Then we used shader magic to
                        displace every vertex based on the
                        color value of each pixel in the texture. The final touch was then to add a very slow and subtle
                        movement using a simple sine function:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now let's add the rocks and the trees. And voil√†!
                    </p>

                    <h3> Occlusion and frustrum culling</h3>
                    <p>
                        The eagle-eyed will have noticed that the terrain looks a lot sharper. That is simply because we
                        upped the number of vertices of every chunk
                        The all terrain is now a whopping 32 Million vertices. Naturally that is way more than we want
                        to display on the screen at any given time
                        and the LOD system is helping reduce that number by a lot. What we can do to reduce it even more
                        is to add more levels of LOD (which are autmagically
                        generated) and then start thinking about occlusion and frustrum culling.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We discovered that Unity does this automatically without any work from our part so the only thing
                        that's left is occlusion culling.
                        Unity provides a pretty solid system of generating volumes that will appear/disappear based on
                        the camera's visibility. What's left
                        to do is to assign to every level a bounding box. This is useful because sometimes if the player
                        goes inside a building, the game will
                        cull everything because it doesn't understand what's supposed to be showing. Once that's fixed
                        we're done!
                        Here's what the camera was rendering before:
                    </p>
                    <img src="../media/675kTris.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">
                    <p>
                        and this is after:
                    </p>
                    <img src="../media/465kTris.jpg" alt="not found" class="image fit">
                    <p>
                        Notice the player is exactly in the same position in both cases. As you can see in the stats
                        tab, we've reduced the number of
                        triangles drawn by quite a lot. Basically the LOD systems takes it from around 10 million to
                        700k and we then reduce that further
                        by using occlusion culling. The improvement might seem small but remember it will get
                        significantly bigger the more levels and objects
                        there are.

                        What about gameplay?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        If you've read these two posts you might think the gameplay is completely absent. In truth, it's
                        mostly there, toghether with
                        obstacles, UI, combat system and inventory system. We will be doing a dive through some of these
                        in future posts while we work on
                        making them more robust and feature rich. Until then, all I can give you is a very small peak:

                        In case you're wondering, the moving platform DOES WORK correctly, I just missed cause I'm bad
                        at my own game :) .
