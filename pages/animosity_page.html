                    This project is a demonstration of <em>Steering behaviours</em> and <em>Genetic algorithms</em>, the goal
                    is to make creatures (represented as dots on the screen) behave differently based on the enviroment. At the
                    start of the simulation an arbitrary amount of creatures is created. The primary and most important
                    steering behaviour is <em>Food Seeking</em>, the type of creature determines what it thinks food is: herbivores
                    will seek plants while predators will chase herbivores. All creatures have a maximum lifetime and health
                    value and if any of these values reach 0 they will die; the health value will increase if the creature is
                    able to eat but the lifetime value will continue ticking down ensuring it won't be able to live forever.
                    All values and parameters for the creatures can be adjusted via the UI but will only be in place for all
                    creatures born <strong>after</strong> the change is made. The graphs show the total number of creatures
                    alive (including plants and predators) and species-specific data over time. The start button will generate
                    an arbitrary amount of creatures to ensure enough DNA variety (see next paragraph), the simulation can be
                    halted and resumed (note that resuming will still generate more creatures as if starting from scrath) to
                    save the graphs or check current levels of attraction and repulsion forces. The most interesting results
                    can be obtained if the simulation is started with arbitrary parameters and then not interfered with; it is
                    still possible for the user to generate more creatures of a specific type if needed.

                    Genetic Algorithm
                </h3>
                <p class="center">
                    The initial DNA parameters for the creatures are randomly generated and control attraction and repulsion
                    forces for food, predators and other creatures. Creature replication simply copies those parameters from
                    the old creature to the new one with a low chance of mutation, for this system to work it must have enough
                    DNA variety at the start of the simulation to avoid creatures dying out because of bad initial DNA
                    parameters. In this case there is no fitness function and the creatures are passively evolving: the better
                    creatures have a higher change of surviving for a longer period and have a higher reproduction rate.

                    Known Issues
                </h3>
                <ul class="center">
                    <li>The simulation is shown in real time but in order for the calculations to perform correctly, FPS can
                    decrease depending on hardware performance. Recovery from a performance dip takes longer than expected
                    </li>
                    <li>The UI scroll bar will not respond to the mouse scroll wheel if the mouse pointer is in the simulation
                    panel (you need to drag the scoll bar down manually).
                    </li>
                    <li>Generating creatures too quickly with the <strong>Generate Creature</strong> and <strong>Generate
                    Predator</strong> button can cause the simulation to freeze (you then need to stop and resume again). This
                    is because you are adding creatures to the Arraylist and it causes some loops to break.
                    </li>
